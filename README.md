# Global-inflation-rate-analysis

Inflation as measured by the consumer price index reflects the annual percentage change in the cost to the average consumer of acquiring a basket of goods and services that may be fixed or changed at specified intervals, such as yearly. The Laspeyres formula is generally used.
World inflation rate for 2020 was 1.94%, a 0.21% decline from 2019.
World inflation rate for 2019 was 2.15%, a 0.27% decline from 2018.
World inflation rate for 2018 was 2.42%, a 0.24% increase from 2017.
World inflation rate for 2017 was 2.18%, a 0.69% increase from 2016.

# Problem Statement
To Predict the inflation rates based on the data between 1981-2020.

## Important Insigts

Global inflation rate from 1981 to 2020
This statistic shows the global inflation rate compared to  year from 1981 to 2020*. In 1981, the inflation rate worldwide amounted to approximately 12.66.
Inflation rates worldwide
Inflation is often defined as the continued increase in the general level of prices of goods and services. Global economy has suffered immensely since the global financial crisis in 2008 and that has caused global inflation to increase. The highest recorded global inflation of the past decade in comparison with the previous year took place in 2008, when it increased by more than 6.4 percent in comparison to the global inflation rate in 2007.
The global regions with the highest year-on-year inflation rate in 2014 are the Middle East and North Africa, as well as Africa Sub-Sahara. The nations in the world with the highest inflation rates in 2015 were Venezuela and Ukraine. Interestingly, in 2015, the inflation rate in Venezuela was approximately three times as high as the inflation rate in Ukraine.
As a result of a global economic downturn, the lack of a sufficient central bank, and the rise in interest rates, the cost of living in the Middle East has also become much higher than in industrialized countries. The inflation rate in industrialized countries in 2015 was just about 0.35 percent. Meanwhile, the inflation rate in the Middle East and North Africa amounted to more than 6.2 percent.
Due to economical progress following the global financial crisis, developed countries in the European Union and the euro area set forth economic strategies to strengthen their economy and maintain a stable economy. In addition, stagnant worker wages and a hesitation from banks to easily distribute loans to ordinary citizens have also caused the inflation rate in the euro zone to be relatively low. In 2015, Grenada and Switzerland reported the lowest inflation rates in 2015 in comparison to the previous year.

# Predictive Modelling results
In order to find a decent model to predict sales we performed an extensive search of various machine learning models(Gradient boosting trees,linear regression, knn etc) available in Python.Random forest regressor algorithm performed particularly well.
